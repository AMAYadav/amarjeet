								<p>

									Passionate about finance and data, I am an economics graduate from 2019 and an enthusiastic FRM Part 1 student. From early on, I was fascinated with the endless possibilities that data can offer, and I've been on a mission to explore and learn as much as I can ever since.

								</p>

								<p>My curiosity led me to self-teach stochastic calculus, linear algebra, and time series, as well as programming languages such as Python, R, and Tableau. Through numerous projects, I've had the opportunity to apply my skills to real-world scenarios, further fueling my excitement and motivation.</p>

								<p>My ultimate goal is to specialize in market risk, where I believe my passion for data and finance can be best utilized. As an individual, I take pride in my work and always strive to go the extra mile. I believe that combining my knowledge and creativity will allow me to make a valuable contribution to any team or organization.</p>

								<p>While I take my career aspirations seriously, I also like to inject a little humor into my work and am always up for a good laugh. I believe that a positive attitude and a willingness to learn are key to personal and professional growth.</p>

I've self-taught myself complex topics like stochastic calculus, linear algebra, time series analysis, Python, R, Tableau, and MYSQL. I've even put my knowledge to the test through several real-world projects, constantly striving to learn and improve.

									My ultimate goal is to make a career in market risk where my passion and expertise in data and finance can be put to good use. I'm a hard-working individual who takes pride in my work and strives to exceed expectations.
